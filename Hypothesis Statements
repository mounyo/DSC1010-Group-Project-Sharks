Semler - I believe most of the shark attacks recorded are going to be somewhere around the eastern coast of the united states due to florida being a hub for shark fishing. I think it's a good idea to look at all countries differently because of their popiulation and ecological outputs.
Odhong - I believe that the activity with the highest attacks is going to be surfing, as it makes victims look like prey, and spear-fishing, because those could become provoked attacks on sharks. I also think locations like the Bahamas and Australia are going to have the highest shark attack because many species of sharks live in the water surrounding.
